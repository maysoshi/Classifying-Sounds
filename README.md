# Urban Sound Classification 

This project aims to classify different urban sounds such as air conditioners, car horns, children playing, dog barks, drilling, engine idling, gunshots, jackhammers, sirens, and street music using machine learning models.

## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of audio recordings of various urban sounds, preprocessed into two formats:
1. Raw amplitude data
2. Mel spectrograms (2D image representations of the audio)

## Approach
The project follows a sequential approach, starting with baseline models and gradually progressing to more complex models:

1. Baseline Models: Logistic regression models trained on raw amplitude data and Mel spectrograms.
2. Non-Probabilistic Models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A deep learning model tailored for 2D image data (Mel spectrograms).
